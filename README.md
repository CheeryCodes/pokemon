# Welcome to My Pokemon App
***

## Task
The task is to create a multiple-page application with ReactJS that displays a list of Pokémon with lazy loading, provides a search bar to filter Pokémon, and shows detailed information about each Pokémon. The challenge lies in handling asynchronous API requests, implementing lazy loading, and managing state efficiently.

## Description
I have solved the problem by using ReactJS along with React Router for routing and Axios for making API requests. The application consists of two main pages: one for displaying the list of Pokémon with lazy loading and a search bar, and another for showing detailed information about a selected Pokémon. Error handling is implemented to manage issues like network errors or invalid API requests.

## Installation
To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
  

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the home page to see the list of Pokémon.
2. Use the search bar to find a specific Pokémon.
3. Click on a Pokémon name to see its details.

Example usage:
```
cd pokemon-app
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```
